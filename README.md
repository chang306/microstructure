## Project Summary

The goal is to evaluate the SMP to SSA conversion coefficients presented by [Colonne et al 2020](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/1829/2020/)
on the Grand Mesa Dataset.

### The problem

What problem are you going to explore? Provide a few sentences. If this is a technical exploration of software or data science methods, explain why this work is important in a broader context.

### Application Example

List one specific application of this work.

### Sample data

#### SMP data (Full) 
    * https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/SNOWEX/SNEX20_SMP.001/
    
### Specific Questions

* Are the coeficients provided by Neige Colonne valid at Grand Mesa?
* If not can we calibrate our own?
